# DCC019-LP-Trabalho3

Repository containing the source code of the final work for the Linguagens de Programação course

## Description

This program implements a programming language called CLASSES. This language tries to mimic the functionality of Object Oriented Programming inside the Racket environment.

Almost all functions and some examples of how to use the program are located inside the file [T3_LP-Documentacao.pdf](https://github.com/Matheus-Avila/DCC019-LP-Trabalho3/blob/main/T3_LP-Documentação.pdf) which is written in Portuguese. The examples are already loaded in the RKT file so they will be executed together with the main program.

## Requirements

- [DrRacket](https://www.swi-prolog.org/) 8.4 or later
- Any text editor (for editing)

## Running the program

\- Clone the repo with:

```
git clone https://github.com/Matheus-Avila/DCC019-LP-Trabalho3.git
```

\- Enter the project folder:

```
cd DCC019-LP-Trabalho3/
```

\- Load the source code inside the interpreter, for eg. using:

```
drracket classes.rkt
```
